    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs.

It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it. You may be wondering: "Do I really need a recipe for buttered noodles?" The answer, of course, is yes. This kid-friendly recipe results in perfect noodles tossed in exactly the right amount of butter.
