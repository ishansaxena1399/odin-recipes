    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>½ medium onion, finely chopped</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>4 cloves garlic, minced</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>½ teaspoon black pepper</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>½ teaspoon dried oregano</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>⅔ cup rolled oats</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2 large eggs, beaten</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
